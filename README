# Groupie Trackers Project

This project is a sub-part of the Groupie-Tracker project which is a web application that allows users to view information about various artists. The app uses the Groupie Trackers API to retrieve artist data.
In this part it is a question of integrating a search bar which will allow users to search for an artist or a group from:
- by name,
- a date,
- a concert venue.
